1.    What day has the most tests?
2.    When are these tests being administered?
3.    Does football has something to do with BAC?
4.    Home advantage, alcohol disadvantage?
5.    Basketball, or football? Which has more influence on our data?
6.    How did the VEISHEA Cancellation affect the patterns?

The dataset contains the following variables: 
1.    DateTime - date & time of test (datetime, "America/Chicago")
2.    Location - who administered the test, Ames PD or ISU PD? (char.)
3.    Gender - gender (M,F) of person being tested (char.)
4.    Res1 - first breath alcohol reading (num.)
